# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion solution

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-wyfFdeBwBz). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

- How to navigate the questions using the keyboard.
- Using the "DOMContentLoaded" to add the event listener.
- Using .forEach to to toggle the questions independently.

### Continued development

- More practise using forEach and event listeners.

### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me understand the DOMContentLoaded property.
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - My initial solution while it worked, was not dynamic. Used chatGPT to help summarize the code and make it more dynamic.
